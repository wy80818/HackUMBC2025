**HackUMBC Cyber Track Submission**
*By Jakub Kotoulek*

This challenge is expected to be completed on linux.
There are 3 parts, the first two could be completed on windows, but the 3rd one requires to 
get information that only exists on linux.

After completing the 3 parts, the flag will be revealed.

The program is called `notMalware`, it's true.
(If you really want to check, you can compile the source code and compare the md5sum)

You only need to run the program using `./notMalware`

Other than that, have fun!
